# Single Page Application

This is a project demo from [Sitepoint's Build a JavaScript Single PAge App Without a Framework](https://www.sitepoint.com/single-page-app-without-framework/)

This project connects the user to exchange rate services via a proxy.

A proxy is needed because we need an API Key to connect to one of the services. This key allows us to access sensitive data so it cannot live on the client. Therefore the API Key will be stored on the server and Express will use the Key to connect to the exchange services
